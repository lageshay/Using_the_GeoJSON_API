# Using_the_GeoJSON_API
Assignment: Use a GeoLocation lookup API modelled after the Google API to look up some universities and parse the returned data. Prompt for a location, contact a web service and retrieve JSON for the web service. Parse that data and retrieve the first place_id from the JSON.   Use this API endpoint that has a static subset of the Google Data: http://py4e-data.dr-chuck.net/json?. Include a key= parameter and provide the address that you are requesting as the address= parameter that is properly URL encoded using the urllib.parse.urlencode() function as shown in http://www.py4e.com/code3/geojson.py.
